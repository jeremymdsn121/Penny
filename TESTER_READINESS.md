# Penny — Tester Readiness Checklist

The ordered punch-list to get Penny from "built" to "all features live" before
onboarding design-partner brokerages. **This is the working backlog**: when Jeremy
asks "what's next?" (or any variation), surface the **next unchecked, non-blocked
item** here — top to bottom — not a dump of the whole list. Check items off and add
dated notes as they're verified.

Legend: `[x]` live-verified · `[ ]` built but not yet verified live · 🔒 blocked on
external approval · ⏸ deferred (out of tester scope).

## Tier 0 — External gates (critical path, not engineering work)

These can't be coded around; they gate whether testers can use the channels at all.
Keep them moving in parallel with the verification sweep.

- [ ] 🔒 **WhatsApp Business API production approval** — primary channel. Number
  `+14053636555` in Meta review. Until approved it's the **sandbox** (testers must
  text `join <word>` — a non-starter). On approval: submit the 5 Utility templates
  in `WHATSAPP_TEMPLATES.md`, set `TWILIO_CONTENT_SIDS` (wiring already done), do the
  single-number cutover. See `project_whatsapp_production` memory + `BLOCKERS.md` HL4.
- [ ] 🔒 **A2P 10DLC SMS approval** — SMS fallback. Resubmitted 2026-06-11, carrier
  review. SMS delivery is filtered until approved. See `project_sms_channel` memory.

## Tier 1 — Live verification sweep (the real work, in your control)

Most of these are code-complete with passing unit/type checks but have **never been
exercised against live services / in a browser in a real brokerage**. Ordered by
tester impact. Each needs a real run + fix-what-breaks.

**Verification bar:** driving the real API/HTTP path on a throwaway tenant (deleted
after) counts as verified — manual browser click-throughs are not required. Accepted
tradeoff: this won't catch a purely visual render bug; typecheck + correct API
responses cover most of it, and the real UI is spot-checked in normal use.

- [x] **1. Core deal flow, fresh brokerage** — VERIFIED 2026-06-11 via the real HTTP
  path on a throwaway tenant (since deleted): signup → JWT carries `brokerage_id` →
  onboarding completes (all tasks default non-autonomous) → extract on a 10-page
  contract returned clean fields with `not_found` correctly empty (no hallucination) →
  transaction created + scoped to the new brokerage; listing under its token returned
  only its own deal (tenant isolation holds). Run with SendGrid/Twilio keys blanked —
  zero outbound. (Browser wizard click-through waived per the verification bar above.)
- [ ] **2. WhatsApp media intake (1A)** — DEFERRED 2026-06-11 (needs a real photo/PDF
  MMS from a phone; revisit when one's available). Text round-trip is live-verified; the
  **PDF/photo MMS** round-trip through `media_extract` → `pending_whatsapp_transactions`
  → YES-commit is not yet exercised.
- [x] **3. Document generation — live send** — VERIFIED 2026-06-11 on a throwaway deal:
  `draft-document` produced a clean status update in Penny's voice; the send **confirm
  gate** rejected `confirmed=false` (400); a real `confirmed=true` SendGrid send returned
  `{sent: true}` to the operator's own inbox (no outside party). **Remaining:** the
  separate **intro-email** send path (`send_intro_email`) wasn't exercised here — quick
  follow-up.
- [x] **4. Deadline reminders firing live** — VERIFIED 2026-06-11 (API, throwaway tenant,
  Twilio blanked). Seeded deadlines at +5/+2/today: one scan fired the correct mark each
  (5day/2day/day) and silently consumed passed marks (flags `(5,2,day)` =
  `(T,F,F)`/`(T,T,F)`/`(T,T,T)`); a second scan processed 0 (**idempotent**). With
  `deadline-reminders` non-autonomous, the party email was held as `pending_confirm` (no
  auto-send). Confirm-gated `notify-parties` rejected `confirmed=false` (400) and sent on
  `confirmed=true` to the operator's inbox. **Not exercised:** the internal WhatsApp nudge
  send (no registered contact; scan no-ops gracefully — needs Twilio + a real number).
- [x] **5. Compliance review (AI pass) + checklist (2A)** — VERIFIED 2026-06-11 (API,
  throwaway tenant). On a deal with the contract on file: the 2A checklist auto-
  instantiated **16 buy-side items** and an item PATCH → `complete` set `completed_at`;
  `compliance-review` ran the **AI contract pass** (`contract_reviewed`) and surfaced 3
  findings (incl. structural "closing date passed, not marked closed" + AI disclosure
  checks), a `suggested_status`, an annotated checklist, and the legal disclaimer; the
  confirm-gated `compliance-decision` rejected `confirmed=false` (400) and recorded on
  `confirmed=true`. (Review is surface-only — it suggests; the human decision sets it.)
- [x] **6. Review queue (2B)** — VERIFIED 2026-06-11 (API, throwaway tenant). Seeded one
  deal per bucket; `GET /broker/review-queue` (admin-gated, `require_admin` accepts
  `broker_in_charge`) sorted **all six** correctly with accurate reasons:
  compliance_attention, past_closing_not_closed ("Closed 1 day ago…"), closing_soon_incomplete
  ("Closing in 3 days, file 0% complete"), overdue_deadlines, emd_overdue, stale_transactions
  ("No activity in 9 days"). **Gotcha learned:** migration 010's `set_last_activity` is a
  `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger that bumps `last_activity_at = now()` on *any* write, so a stale
  deal can't be seeded by an UPDATE — seed it with a **direct INSERT** carrying an old
  `last_activity_at` (no update trigger fires). In production deals go stale naturally
  (nothing writes to them for 7+ days).
- [x] **7. Workflow tasks (3)** — VERIFIED 2026-06-11 (API, throwaway tenant). All three
  triggers fired from the buy-side seed: **create** → 4 `under_contract` stage-entry tasks;
  **stage→pending** → 3 more (appraisal / title commitment); an **inspection deadline @+5
  + reminder scan** → "Confirm inspection is scheduled" (days_before_deadline).
  `get_pending_tasks` bucketed every pending task correctly by due date (overdue / today /
  this week / upcoming).
- [ ] **8. EMD receipt tracking (5)** — browser walk of the EMD card: set amount/due,
  upload a receipt to `compliance-docs`, confirm-gated mark-received.
- [x] **9. Comparable sales + property record (Rentcast)** — VERIFIED 2026-06-11 against
  live Rentcast: `comps` returned an estimate ($224k) + 6 comparables; `property-record`
  returned the full public profile (year built, sqft, beds/baths, last sale, and
  tax-assessment / property-tax history). Note: Rentcast returned no value range for this
  address (estimate + comps only) — data variance, not a bug.
- [ ] **10. MLS listing prep** — upload a listing packet, AI-extract fields, save via
  `listings` CRUD. Push stays a no-op seam (expected).
- [ ] **11. Broker reporting (7)** — live render of `/reports` (pipeline / production /
  compliance health) + CSV export, against real closed/active deals.
- [ ] **12. AI disclosure + consent (6)** — disclosure footer on a real send; exercise
  the HMAC consent link path (`CONSENT_SECRET`) end to end.
- [ ] **13. Two-way email (Phase 1 + 2)** — inbound from an internal agent triggers the
  agent loop reply; inbound from an outside party drafts into `pending_email_replies`
  and briefs the agent; `approve_and_send_reply` / `schedule_reply` / the
  `/email/run-scheduled-replies` scan. Inbound threading itself is live; the auto-reply
  layer isn't.
- [ ] **14. Email delivery events (025) + Activity timeline (026)** — both migrations
  applied 2026-06-11 but not exercised: set up the SendGrid Event Webhook, force a
  bounce, confirm it records + nudges the agent; render the per-deal Activity timeline.
- [ ] **15. Per-agent style (1B)** — agent-profile style CRUD; confirm agent-specific
  rules merge over brokerage-wide and win on conflict in a real doc generation.

## Tier 2 — Production hardening before real client NPI

- [ ] **Unattended cron actually scheduled** — point a Render Cron Job at
  `POST /api/v1/cron/run-scans` with `X-Cron-Secret` (set `CRON_SECRET`). Without it,
  reminders + scheduled-reply resurfacing only run from the dashboard dev buttons.
- [ ] **Frontend custom domain** — currently `sloane-web.onrender.com`; move to
  `app.poweredbypenny.com` (and rebuild with `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).
- [ ] **NPI / data posture** — only HL6 interim retention exists (no SOC 2). Fine for
  design partners with test data; have the explicit conversation before real client PII
  at scale. See `BLOCKERS.md` HL6.
- [ ] **Multi-seat decision** — `require_admin` is a no-op; one admin login per
  brokerage. Confirm that's acceptable for testers (agents use WhatsApp/SMS, not logins)
  or scope real multi-seat.

## ⏸ Deferred — explicitly out of tester scope (behind seams)

- ⏸ DocuSign e-signature (Section 8) — seam reports "not connected."
- ⏸ MLS publishing — per-market write integration; no universal API.
- ⏸ Microsoft/Outlook calendar — columns + seam exist, not wired (Google is live).
